# Reconstucting the 2016 Zika outbreak in Puerto Rico

This is a collaboration between the CDC Dengue Branch and the Yale School of Public Health. Our data can be visualized on our [Nextstrain community build](https://nextstrain.org/community/grubaughlab/ZIKV-PR).

## Samples

[Add info]

## Methods

The Zika virus samples were sequenced using our [PrimalSeq protocol] (https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2017.066) and consensus sequences were generated using [iVar] (https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1618-7).

Detailed methods can be found on our website: http://grubaughlab.com/open-science/amplicon-sequencing/

## Nextstrain

Some of our analyses were performed using the nextstrain (`augur`) pipeline. These results can be visualized using `auspice`, accessing the link below:
